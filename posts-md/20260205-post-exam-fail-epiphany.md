## Context: Posing the problem

This morning, I took the final exam in Algebra, which also ended my first semester in university. Algebra is arguably the subject that I have spent the most time on, so I should be able to ace the exam with ease. That, though, did not happen, as I made several independent calculation mistakes, and it's likely I will be getting a B in Algebra!

I was upset for sure, but at the same time confused: I have always been known to be scrupulous in any exams I take, so today's incident is definitely an anomaly I have to investigate.

## Seeking the answer

The number one suspect is sleep deprivation. It ticks every check box: (1) sleep deprivation compromises one's attention, and I did continue to make (an unholy amount of) silly mistakes throughout today; (2) I have never been this sleep-deprived before and exam (a whole week of bad sleep!). And as I couldn't come up with any more plausible explanation, I will accept this as the main cause for today's incident.

Diving deeper, as to what may have caused my sleep deprivation. I pinpointed 2 causes:

1. There have been too much work I have to juggle in university: studying (much greater workload than in high school), co-curricular activities (personal projects, etc.), and misc adult responsibilities.
2. I have not been able to handle those workload efficiently.

## So, what's next for me?

For the former (1st) cause, my high workload is hardly compromisable, as I know what I need to do to prepare for my career.

For the latter (2nd) cause: I have been mostly relying on the "bursts of energy" approach, that is doing what I want to do at any given time. This used to work wonders for me in high school, supposedly because my stable school schedule and small workload optimized those "energy bursts", helping me to pull off any tasks with my greatest dedication. Clearly I no longer have those luxuries as a university student, so those "energy bursts" end up piling up my unfinished work, then eating up my sleep time to compensate. Those "piles" were especially high before my finals, which explains my sleep loss, and hence my inability to focus.

What I will try first, is to reorganize my tasks and fit them on the time table. I have tried chunking my tasks to smaller subtasks and setting deadlines for each (using Google Calendar), which I found very effective. I will definitely try to make that the default way to organize tasks from the next semester.

## Final takeaways

The (probable) B grade is a disappointing outlier in my transcript, but it has revealed the systematic flaw in how I approach studying and other tasks as a university student. In the following semesters, I'm not just aiming for straight A's, but also for turning into a disciplined person who knows how to harness his full potential.
