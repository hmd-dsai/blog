## My "villain arc" backstory

Throughout primary and secondary school, I had been known to be exceptional at maths, and I in fact really enjoyed learning maths. But there was something I felt deeply insecure about: my shyness (you may find it unrelated, but stick with me). I didn't have a large social circle, and always find it awkward to start a conversation with anyone. That insecurity only gets magnified as I stepped into a high school for gifted students, where everyone around me was not only talented academically but also socially, and I couldn't help comparing myself to others.

There was this pervasive stereotype that STEM students are nerdy socially awkward, which specifically hit my insecurity. Hence, at 11th grade when I had to start settling my career orientation, I decided I need a change, and what greater change than jumping from STEM majors to Business major, eh?

## Phase 1: Exploring Business field

### 2024/06/02 - Business Discussion Hub

I participated in "Business Discussion Hub" (hosted by Aiesec Vietnam), and in 2 domains: Research & Development and Sales. It was like a seminar/workshop for high school students to gain first-hand experience in specific domains of business.

I was really satisfied, in that I stepped way out of my comfort zone in participating in this. First, I met and had convos with new talented friends who all came from high schools for the gifted in Hanoi. Next, I got to hear from experienced specialists in the field who shared with us the fundamentals of business, the insights into their jobs, the job market prospect, and so on. Then, my teammates and I worked on solutions to business problems posed by the organizers, pitched our ideas, and got very detailed feedback from those specialists.

Overall, it was a truly satisfying experience, and it successfully fueled my interest for business.

### 2024/11-12 - Dash for Impact Business Competition

This was when I got serious enough to sign up for a national business competition. In preparation, I spent months learning business fundamentals and connected some friends and seniors for advice. Our team had to take an MCQ test for the 1st round, and make a detailed business campaign (taking the roles of Product, Marketing, Sales, and Finance teams) for launching a tech solution for the 2nd (semi-final) round (I'm being vague here, but I can send you the question prompt for this round through email if you want). We didn't get into the finals, though.

Overall, I'd consider this an *insightful* experience. There were a lot of things I realized after this competition:
1. The Business Discussion Hub was only meant to be a friendly introduction into business, unlike here in Dash for Impact where I got to experience first-hand what working in business was actually like in real life (or at least close to what it was actually like). It was incredibly stressful with too much on the to-do list for a very limited amount of time.
2. *Stress* is something I would expect from any job, but in this competition, I don't find it an enjoyable type of *stress* (mind the emphasis!). I did not feel like continuing work at any point, and it always felt like a burden to me. I supposed it was because *I was not doing what I enjoy*, and given the context of career orientation, this was a critical finding.

Still, one part of the competition that somewhat intrigued me was the market research, in particular, the charts and diagrams I had to analyze. We were only expected to draw insights from those using our business knowledge and common sense, but I felt like I should have been able to harness more from those data. And that was the moment I stumbled on the field of *Data Analytics*.

## Phase 2: Intermediary phase

By *Data Analytics*, I specifically meant *Business Data Analytics*, because after all I still have reasons to be reluctant about giving up Business.

I started exploring this field by taking some online courses, like *Data Analytics* on Forage, and notably, *Google Machine Learning Crash Course* (which I'll be referring to as *GMLCC*). GMLCC particularly intrigued me in their thorough explanation (very mathematically based) of concepts like Linear Regression and the like.

The concept I remember the most (and probably the first thing I'd remember when anyone mentions GMLCC) is *Gradient Descent*. Bear in mind I learned about this as a 12th grade student, knew knows nothing about gradients, and was thrown in the face with a formula with a bunch of ∂'s. I had to spend days trying to wrap my head around this, watching a bunch of YouTube videos on partial derivatives and the like, before the "Eureka" moment. Learning maths was indeed *stressful*, but this time it was different. At no point did I find myself wanting to just give up and accept that "gradient descent works", instead, I just kept learning from this knowledge to that knowledge to over-there knowledge until I fully understood what gradient descent represents (you can say I got really deep into the rabbit hole). This time, the *stress* was actually enjoyable.

I did one last step to make this phase complete: do a Business Analytics project, using what I've learned. I got a marketing dataset from the Internet, and did EDA (Exploratory Data Analytics) and Predictive Analysis on it. In case you're interested, you can view the project on my GitHub: <https://github.com/hmd-dsai/ifood-marketing-campaign-analysis>.

## Phase 3: Final decision

This was some time in early-mid 2025. My high school era was about to end, and I had to settle on an undergraduate program to pursue.

Back to the maths story. After all those exposure, my attitude to maths had changed dramatically. I learned that maths was something I deeply enjoy learning and something I was excellent at. I also learned that maths and social skills are not incompatible, in that I can still excel at Business and be good at maths at the same time.

My strategy for the program choice was, to choose something (1) I'm good at doing, (2) I enjoy to do, (3) the society needs me to do. With that and all my experiences in mind, Data Science & AI (DS-AI) was clearly my best option. In fact, I just received my acceptance notice into the DS-AI program at Hanoi University of Science and Technology today (my first preference!).

Will I regret that choice? I don't know, as it is still too early to tell. But I'm certain that's not likely to happen, after all those experiences I had and thorough considerations.
- P/S (2026/01): I *absolutely* do not regret this decision. I am learning everything I enjoy (Calculus, Algebra, etc.), meeting talented people around me, pushing myself through *stressful but enjoyable* hackathons, and so on.

## Rewind: Do my Business experiences go to waste?

No. Because:
1. They gave me my confidence that I'm not socially awkward at all even if I'm good at maths, as these two phenomena are not correlated from the start.
2. This point is more impactful: I learned a lot about how businesses function, about market mentality and the like. This gives me filters whenever I kick off a tech project: does my project solve a particular problem of a group of people; is my project going to be financially sustainable; etc. I'm also much more ready to try and launch a project to the market when I have knowledge of how markets function.

## Final words, in case you are lost in career orientation

From this very specific personal experience of mine, my single 2 pieces of advice would be:
1. Don't let your insecurities overwhelm your decisions.
2. Try to gain first-hand experience of the jobs you're interested in (if you still have time). It is much, much more insightful than reading "Ten Reasons to Start Learning DS-AI Today" off the Internet.

If you're having trouble in career orientation, don't hesitate to contact me ;). I wouldn't say I have all the information you need (after all I'm only 18 watcha expect), but I'd be happy to help you to the best of my ability as I used to be in the same boat.
